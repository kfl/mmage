Simple image library with functional interface for Moscow ML, based on
SDL2. Hopefully to be used in Introduction to Programming, 2013.


What works:
* Reading from files works
* Showing images works
* Setting individual pixels works somewhat

Not working:
* Creating (make) a blank image?!?
* transform. When addressing pixels in 24bit images something is not right.

Not implemented:
* blit, transform{i,Rect,Recti}
