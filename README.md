Simple image library with functional interface for Moscow ML, based on
SDL2. Hopefully to be used in Introduction to Programming, 2013.


What works:
* Reading from files works
* Showing images works
* Setting individual pixels works
* Creating (make) a blank image
* transform works

Not implemented:
* blit, transform{i,Rect,Recti}
* Documentation

Unknown:
* Is performance usable? (small tests suggests that it is)
* Is the API right?
* Will it work with the Android port of Moscow ML?
